PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The program will total up the bowler's scores.  In a loop, the program will ask for the bowler to enter their scores for each game that they bowled. 
The program will collect the bowler's scores until the bowler enters done to quit. Once all the scores has been gathered, the program will 
display the total number of scores collected. Each entered scores will be added to the total score. When the bowler enters done, it will 
terminate the loop and output the total. Then the program will display "Great job bowling today!."
